* Bio: [cass.md](cass.md "mention") died at the age of 6 during the [the-red-day.md](../events/the-red-day.md "mention"). Her father [harold.md](../side-characters/harold.md "mention")who was a doctor specialized in genetics, was never able to overcome the grief and researched for years a way to bring his daughter back to life. He eventually found a potential way to bring back his daugter spirit, but it could only be returned to a human construct made with magic and the dead's dna. The procedure opened a gateway between the material plane of existence and all the other planes of existence, from there [harold.md](../side-characters/harold.md "mention") used en enchantment that bound with his daughter dna acted as a beacon that called the spirit that inhaited the body with that dna, but since the gateway was opened, other entities perceived this opening and while many of these entities had no interest in it, some others, like demons, yearned for an opportunity to enter in the plane of existence inhabitated by other living beings. Demons long for possessing other living beings who have the ability to have feelings because some specific feelings are the best source of food and energy for some kind of demons, and these demons, while in their plane of existence have physical forms, their body cannot cross the gateway to other planes of esitence, and can only do in form of spirit, form that cannot survive for more than a few minutes in the material plane, therefore they need to be either invoked buy a living being and make sure the demon could posses someone fast or, like in this much much rarer case, possess a human body without a soul, a much easier way. One demon among all had the audacity and the resolution to use this opportunity to riks his life and enter in the material plane. Before that, [cass.md](cass.md "mention") spirit appeared but she refused to enter in the contruct made as her specular image of her (we talked to give the player the choice if let the spirit enter the contruct or not). Since the spirit couldn't/wouldn't enter the contruct than [demon-in-cass.md](../side-characters/demon-in-cass.md "mention") took advantage of the situation to possess the construct.
