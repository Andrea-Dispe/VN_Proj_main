* Bio: [demetria.md](demetria.md "mention") is a Cleric of the order of [page-4.md](../gods/page-4.md "mention"). Her parents gave her to the church of [page-4.md](../gods/page-4.md "mention") when she was born due to their poverty and inability to keep her fed. She grew up in a pretty strict dogmatic environment. She studied since childhood anything related to [page-4.md](../gods/page-4.md "mention") and became a cleric when she was 15, the youngest cleric the church of [page-4.md](../gods/page-4.md "mention") ever had. When she was 23 she met [placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md](../side-characters/placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md "mention")a boy of her age who came from another town and who just became a cleric and she had the task to initiate him to the common life of the church. After working together for 2 years they fell inlove and had sex despite the code of conduct they were trained in forbids any pysical pleasure for the fellows of [placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md](../side-characters/placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md "mention").  In the year 734 she and [placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md](../side-characters/placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md "mention")were assigned the job to kill what it was believed to be a very young and weak vampire in the town on the hill closed by. The reasearch of the vampire was easy but it turned out that the vampire was very, very old and very powerful. he just made everyone to believe he was young and weak to attract people to end up being their drink.



[demetria.md](demetria.md "mention") was given to the Church of [page-4.md](../gods/page-4.md "mention") at birth by her impoverished parents, who were unable to provide for her. Raised in a strict and dogmatic environment, she immersed herself in the study of [page-4.md](../gods/page-4.md "mention") from a young age. Her dedication and hard work paid off when, at the age of 15, she became the youngest cleric in the history of the Church of [page-4.md](../gods/page-4.md "mention").

At 23, she met a young man her age named [placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md](../side-characters/placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md "mention"), who had recently joined the church from another town. Tasked with initiating him into the daily life of the church, she spent two years working closely with him. During this time, they developed a deep bond, eventually falling in love and engaging in a forbidden physical relationship, despite the church's strict code of conduct prohibiting such pleasures.

In the year 734, [demetria.md](demetria.md "mention") and  [placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md](../side-characters/placeholder-demetria-boyfriend.md "mention")were assigned a mission to eliminate what was believed to be a young and weak vampire in a nearby hill town. The search for the vampire was straightforward, but they soon discovered that their target, [vampire-valen-blackthorn.md](../side-characters/vampire-valen-blackthorn.md "mention"), as actually an ancient and powerful vampire. [vampire-valen-blackthorn.md](../side-characters/vampire-valen-blackthorn.md "mention")had deceived everyone into believing he was young and weak to lure victims for his sustenance, victims who wanted some fast and easy fame and glory by killing a vampire.

The 2 were swiftly outmatched by[vampire-valen-blackthorn.md](../side-characters/vampire-valen-blackthorn.md "mention")and they were both bitten initiating the vampirism procedure.&#x20;

She wakes up and finds no one around, she knows her lover also got vampirezed but he disappeared. \
She goes back to the church, while she goes back, she thinks and convince herself that the church, that took car eof her since she was a child, will find a way to remove the vampizirzation.&#x20;

But that doesnt happen. She got rejected and attacked, she manage to escape from the church fellows who want to kill her as their dogma impose them to, an act of compassion, thanks to the [placeholder-priest-1.md](../side-characters/placeholder-priest-1.md "mention").
