[the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention")was founded in the year 694 as a mercenary guild in the city of [londar.md](../cities/londar.md "mention").&#x20;

It has a façade of being a guild just and righteous working only for those employers whose intentions fit with their code of righteous conduct (referred in the game as the CRC) but in reality, since the beginning, it created an underground network of spies, thieves and assassins whose operations allowed the [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention") to grow bigger and more powerful to the point that it became the most powerful ally of the crown. So, while in the open their leaders promotes the image of an organization of mercenaries that fight for just causes, their aim was to take control of the most strategic roles and activities of [the-soledar-kingdom.md](../empires/the-soledar-kingdom.md "mention").&#x20;

In the year 722  a rumor was spread that the [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention") was secretly forming a private army, an operation that was forbidden by the royal laws that imposed that no house could have a private army, nor hire mercenaries without the consent of the crown, but allowed to have a certain limited number of private guards. A second rumor followed the first implying that the private army was to be used to dethrone the king and take control over [londar.md](../cities/londar.md "mention").  The leaders of [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention") realized that this was a very good opportunity to earn more power by exploiting this rumor, regardless it was true or false. Reason for this to be:

* If the [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention") was really building its own army and really intended to dethrone the king, then with the crown's army and the new [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention") private army, the [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention")would have no reason to exist anymore.&#x20;
* By discovering and arresting the usurper [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention")would have complete  trust of the crown giving it also a seat at the table of the board of advisors, a role second only to the king himself.&#x20;
* The crown's army had the control over the import and export operations of the dock and so also for everything that concerns inspections and law enforcement for every product that comes in and goes out from [londar.md](../cities/londar.md "mention"), the most important trading center of the whole kingdom. By saving the current crown, [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention") would demand as reward to take control over the import and export operation at the docks, a position that could bring the benefit to collect bribes and control the supplying of drugs and black market products.
* Then  by controlling the docks import and export operations they could a draft a pact with the[the-house-mormere.md](../houses/the-house-mormere.md "mention"), the house whose wealth was created entirely by their commercial fleet (which was also secretly the biggest exporter of drugs in the capital),  [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention")would overlook the export controls and facilitate the export of [the-house-mormere.md](../houses/the-house-mormere.md "mention")drugs out of the dock, and for that the [the-house-mormere.md](../houses/the-house-mormere.md "mention")would pay bribes to [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention").
* Not only that,  but [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention") made a second pact with [the-house-mormere.md](../houses/the-house-mormere.md "mention") that by taking down the [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention"), [the-house-mormere.md](../houses/the-house-mormere.md "mention") would become the most influential and powerful house of [the-soledar-kingdom.md](../empires/the-soledar-kingdom.md "mention"), and when it would come the time of dividing and allocating [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention") properties and businesses to the most suited houses of [the-soledar-kingdom.md](../empires/the-soledar-kingdom.md "mention"), then [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention") would convince the crown to entrust the biggest empire's production and storage of the salt (the main wealth provider of the  [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention")) using the newfound political power provided by having now one of the five seat to the board of advisors and using the undeniable reason that [the-house-mormere.md](../houses/the-house-mormere.md "mention")owning the biggest and best commercial fleet, this would become the perfect synergy to export the salt at a lower price beating competition and gaining market shares in favour to the crown. This second agreement would also see  [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention") to earn a substantial share of the profit of the salt business and also they provided guards and security to the production plants.

So they initiated the plan:

* First they tasked [the-unnamed.md](the-unnamed.md "mention") to employ [nymeria.md](../main-characters/nymeria.md "mention"), at that time she was 10, to work for the [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention")as a servant while spying and reporting information and names of those who knew something about a possible confirmation of the rumor or not. Then she was tasked to implant letters, some with fake information, some with blackmailing content.&#x20;
* They kidnapped and torture people who could potentially have some information about the possibe coup d'état&#x20;
* They bribed and blackmail some minor [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention") members to testify against   [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention")
* They reported all the fake proofs and extorted confessions to the crown&#x20;
* Demanded and obtained the task to arrest the [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention") members. The night of the arrest there was a big fight between [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention") and [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention")but in the end they were arrested.

Few weeks later, after a dubious court trial, [the-house-lyncaster.md](../houses/the-house-lyncaster.md "mention") was found guilty and its members executed publicly.&#x20;

Now in the year 734 [the-crimson-shields-legion.md](the-crimson-shields-legion.md "mention") power is still strong and its undergrund network as powerful as always.
