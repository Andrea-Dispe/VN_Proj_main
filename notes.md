# Notes

* In [netherveil.md](planes-of-existence-spheres/netherveil.md "mention") it is explained how the essences live and serve the Essentari. Especially how if an Essentari dies, the essence dies also but not if the other way around occurs. We could use this in some dialogue where the Essentari and the essence argue about something and the essence rant about this.
